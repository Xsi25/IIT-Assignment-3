                        <p>
                            I’m an Australian currently completing a Bachelor of IT with a minor in Digital Design at RMIT. <br><br>
                            My interest in IT was sparked early, playing around on my father’s Commodore 64 with floppy drive. I love to design and build things, and enjoy researching, designing and producing innovative PC builds. I’m fascinated by many things in IT, including network security programming and the dynamic PC hardware landscape.<br>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I have experience as an electrical systems technician, troubleshooting and reparing hardware and software for parking meters, and am the go-to person for Windows trouble shooting and technical support for family and friends.

                        <p>
                            I enjoy researching, designing and producing innovative PC builds, creating digital art, and online gaming. I am a board game fanatic, my collection spans 1200 titles and my favorite genres are legacy/campaign, war, area control and heavy Euro games.

                            Big 5 personality: Empathetic idealist – analytical thinker <br><br>
                            The test results highlight my preference for structure and organisation which I can use to help the team organise work flow and keep on track for deadlines. I tend to be a quiet worker and dislike confrontation, this can both be a positive for the team as I try to resolve conflict when it arises, but can also  influence my willingness to delegate tasks and ask for help. Having an awareness of my test results might provide other members of the group insight into how and why I approach the project and tasks in a particular way.

                            I was born in China, but grew up in Australia, and got to enjoy the best of both worlds. I am fluent in English and speak Mandarin Chinese at an advanced level. <br><br>
                            My interest in IT began when I moved to Australia at age 6. At my first computer lesson in year 2, I saw a 25 Apple IIe computers lined up on the desks. When I turned mine on and started tapping away at the keyboard, watching the screen light up, I was hooked. I started learning as much as I could from class, books, magazines and through trial and error at every opportunity.

                            I have significant IT experience in Windows and Office 365 troubleshooting support. I have some experience with design tools including Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Dreamweaver.

                            I'm a comoputer game fanatic and can lose hours playing Dota 2, World of Warcraft and multiple coop titles. I also enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes that I find on Yummly. It’s a great feeling seeing friends and family try and enjoy new cuisines at my table.

                            My test results reflect my preference for working independently and solving problems strategically. I’m happiest when given a task and allowed the freedom to complete it as I please. While I do my best to work collaboratively with colleagues, I prefer meetings to be direct and to the point so that I can get back to work on my tasks. I know that communication will be key in completing this project effectively, and my test results highlight for me the importance of keeping lines of communication open with my team.

                            I grew up in Cairn, Australia, but I now live in Victoria studying at RMIT and working as a meat inspector. <br><br>I first became interested in IT when I received a Lego robotics kit as a gift. I was young and loved the endless possibilites I had to create different types of semi-autonomous robots. My designs started off very simple and often fell apart upon impact of a wall at high speed. Over time, The robots I built became more sophisticated and I would program them to navigate through the house by themselves.

I enjoy having areas of interest in common with team members and find that this often helps build trust within the team.

                        <p>
                            A child of Argentine parents, I spent most of my youth in Australia, but frequently travelled back and forth between Sydney and Argentina. As a result of the frequent travel, I completed some of my primary and high school education in Spanish.<br><br>
                            I had little exposure to technology in my childhood and teen years, and I knew very little about it until I found myself working for an IT company in 1988. Since then, I have worked in various non-technology roles within IT companies. My interest in pursuing IT more than 20 years later is driven by a desire to develop a deeper understanding of technology fundamentals.

                            I have 22 years of experience working in large technology companies, primary focused on product management, marketing and channel strategy. Surprisingly, none of these roles have required a foundation in technology, as they support or work with technical teams in operations, business and marketing administration.

                            I enjoy travelling and researching about new countries, cultures and history. When not travelling, you'll likely find me researching new places to visit. I use travel as an excuse to educate my children about new cultures and to unwind.

The results also indicate that I am a master multi-tasker and a quick learner. Working as part of a team, I am adaptable and even where I am not the subject matter expert or comfortable with a topic or task, I will embrace an activity openly to support my team and would make the effort to quickly learn, and to seek support to understand something so we could be successful as a team in our project.

                        <p>
                            I was born in Vietnam and I'm currently studying IT at RMIT as an international student. I completed some schooling in Australia and can speak both Vietnamese and English fluently. I am currently employed as a software and web developer.<br><br>
                            My interest in IT started at a very young age. I spent a lot of time with my cousin playing computer games and tinkering with systems. Currently, my interest is shifting towards Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
                        </p>
                        <h6 class="text-info font-weight-bold">IT experience</h6>
                        <p>
                            I have a lot of programming experience and have been working as a software and web developer for 5 years.
                        </p>
                        <h6 class="text-info font-weight-bold">Hobbies</h6>
                        <p>
                            I enjoy programming, tinkering with IT and electronic systems and DIY. Aside from that, I also enjoy movie nights with my wife and love playing tennis.
                        </p>
                        <h6 class="text-info font-weight-bold">Team profile</h6>

                            Big Five Personality Test: O=54% C=58% E=27% A=35% N=12.5%<br><br>
                            The test results help me understand more about myself and my traits. They also give me suggestions for self-improvement. The results indicate that I am a logical and abstract thinker, and this reflects my love of thinking about how things work and what makes them work. It also shows that I am 50% introverted which is quite accurate. I do prefer to work by myself in a quiet environment. Knowing these results will help the team assign tasts based on individual strengths.

                            There are a range of ideal jobs in our group, including full stack developer, software engineer, UX/UI designer and Channels Director. Despite the diversity of job titles, there are significant similarities in both the general and technical skills and knowledge required for most of these roles.<br><br>
                            Technically, four out of five of the roles required knowledge of programming languages, and three required knowledge of modern web development frameworks,
                            cross platform abilities and experience with Agile methods. In terms of general skills, all of the roles require well-developed communication skills (written/oral), team work skills and interpersonal skills. There was also a strong call for project management skills, research and analysis skills, and passion and enthusiasm in the respective advertisements. Four out of five of the roles explicitly required the completion of at least a Bachelor degree.<br><br>
                            The main differences between roles can be seen in the specific technical skills required in some areas, for example, UX/UI design skills, wireframing and prototyping, and cloud experience, and in the relative importance of leadership skills. One of the roles is a senior management role, which is different from the other four roles that are more narrowly focused on specific and technical IT roles. The management role requires more than 10 years of experience,
                            where the other roles require 0-5 years of experience. In addition, only the senior management position requires the completion of postgraduate business qualifications.<br><br>
                            While the job titles vary, the analysis of the team’s ideal job advertisements reveals significant similarities in terms of both the general and specific skills that we need to develop to succeed in obtaining these roles.

                            The GitHub audit trail does not reflect our group’s work well as we chose to collaborate using Microsoft Teams. This means that the Git audit trail is limited to showing who uploaded completed artifacts rather than showing the progress of each artifact towards completion. The Git audit trail also doesn’t effectively show the range of IT tools that we used to complete the assignment. We used a range of different technology tools to map our project, collaborate and assign tasks, produce artifacts and track the completion of components.

                            Microsoft Teams became our primary chat and collaboration tool. Within Microsoft Teams, the primary functions we used to collaboration were “Posts” to raise questions, discuss ideas and update the team on progress. We also used “Files”, where all files were uploaded for the purpose of sharing, updated and editing.          </p>
