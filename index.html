                        <p>I’m an Australian currently completing a Bachelor of IT with a minor in Digital Design at RMIT. <br><br>My interest in IT was sparked early, playing around on my father’s Commodore 64 with floppy drive. I love to design and build
                            things, and enjoy researching, designing and producing innovative PC builds. I’m fascinated by many things in IT, including network security programming and the dynamic PC hardware landscape.<br></p>

                        <p>I have experience as an electrical systems technician, troubleshooting and reparing hardware and software for parking meters, and am the go-to person for Windows trouble shooting and technical support for family and friends.<br></p>

                            <p>I enjoy researching, designing and producing innovative PC builds, creating digital art, and online gaming. I am a board game fanatic, my collection spans 1200 titles and my favorite genres are legacy/campaign, war, area control
                                and heavy Euro games.<br></p>

                                I can use to help the team organise work flow and keep on track for deadlines. I tend to be a quiet worker and dislike confrontation, this can both be a positive for the team as I try to resolve conflict when it arises,
                                but can also influence my willingness to delegate tasks and ask for help. Having an awareness of my test results might provide other members of the group insight into how and why I approach the project and tasks in a particular

                        <p>Born in China, grew up in Australia, and got to enjoy the best of both worlds. Fluent in English and can speak a decent amount of Mandarin Chinese. <br><br>My interest in IT began since I first moved to Australia when I was 6 years
                            old. It began when I went to my first computer class in grade 2, I saw a whole bunch of Apple IIe computers lined up on the desks. When I turned it on and started tapping away at the old keyboards, seeing the screen light up,
                            I was hooked. From then on, I started learning as much as I could from class, books, magazines and through trial and error whenever given the chance.<br></p>

                        <p>My IT experience mostly involve Windows and Office 365 troubleshooting support. I have some experience in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Dreamweaver from personal interest, but they’re not needed in my current job.<br></p>

                            <p>I’m a huge fan of all types of computer games, wasting countless hours away in Dota 2, World of Warcraft and multiple coop titles. I also enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes that I find off websites like Yummly. It’s a
                                great feeling seeing friends and family try and enjoy new cuisines through food that I’ve made.<br></p>

                                problems strategically. I’m happy to be given a task and be allowed the freedom to complete it without outside interference. While I do my best to work with colleagues in group situations, I prefer meetings to be direct
                                and to the point so that I can get back to work on my tasks. That said, communication will be key in this project and it’s something I will be mindful of while working with my team members.<br></p>

                        <p>I have grown up in Australia specifically Cairns, I now live in Victoria studying at RMIT and working as a meat inspector. <br><br>I first became interested in IT when I received a Lego robotics kit as a gift. This gave me the
                            opportunity at a young age to create all different sorts of semi-autonomous robots. They started off very simple often falling apart upon impact of a wall at high speed. The robots I built soon became more sophisticated and
                            were able to navigate through the house in different ways by themselves.&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <h6 class="text-info"><strong>IT experience</strong></h6>
                        <p>I have 7 years part time, weekend experience using point of sale software in a hardware shop. However, this required more customer troubleshooting than IT problem solving.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p>I have lots of hobbies:&nbsp;&nbsp;CAD design and machine pathways in fusion 360.&nbsp;3D printing.&nbsp;Drone building, designing, programming, innovation, flying and destroying.&nbsp;Arduino projects, specifically custom drone
                            and remote-control programming and CNC machine building.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p>I have been raised predominately in Australia by Argentine parents who moved back and forth between Sydney and Argentina. Part of my primary and high school education was taught in spanish. <br><br>Technology was never part of
                            my upbringing or teenage years and was therefore not on my radar until I fell into a job working in an IT company in 1998. Since then, I have worked in various non-technology roles within IT companies. My interest in pursuing
                            IT study more than 22 years later is driven by a desire to develop a deeper understanding technology fundamentals to progress my career.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p>I have 22 years of experience working in large technology companies, primary focused on product management, marketing and channel strategy. Surprisingly, none of the above roles have required a pre-requisite in technology. They
                            are all roles that support or work with technical teams in operational, business and marketing administration.&nbsp;<br></p>

                            about new cultures and unwind.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p>There are a range of ideal jobs in our group, including full stack developer, software engineer, UX/UI designer and Channels Director. Despite the diversity of job titles, there are significant similarities in both the general and
                            technical skills and knowledge required for most of these roles.<br><br>Technically, four out of five of the roles required knowledge of programming languages, and three required knowledge of modern web development frameworks,
                            cross platform abilities and experience with Agile methods. In terms of general skills, all of the roles require well-developed communication skills (written/oral), team work skills and interpersonal skills. There was also a strong
                            call for project management skills, research and analysis skills, and passion and enthusiasm in the respective advertisements. Four out of five of the roles explicitly required the completion of at least a Bachelor degree.<br><br>The
                            main differences between roles can be seen in the specific technical skills required in some areas, for example, UX/UI design skills, wireframing and prototyping, and cloud experience, and in the relative importance of leadership
                            skills. One of the roles is a senior management role, which is different from the other four roles that are more narrowly focused on specific and technical IT roles. The management role requires more than 10 years of experience,
                            where the other roles require 0-5 years of experience. In addition, only the senior management position requires the completion of postgraduate business qualifications.<br><br>While the job titles vary, the analysis of the team’s
                            ideal job advertisements reveals significant similarities in terms of both the general and specific skills that we need to develop to succeed in obtaining these roles.<br><br></p>
