                        <p>
                            I’m an Australian currently completing a Bachelor of IT with a minor in Digital Design at RMIT. <br><br>
                            My interest in IT was sparked early, playing around on my father’s Commodore 64 with floppy drive. I love to design and build things, and enjoy researching, designing and producing innovative PC builds. I’m fascinated by many things in IT, including network security programming and the dynamic PC hardware landscape.<br>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I have experience as an electrical systems technician, troubleshooting and reparing hardware and software for parking meters, and am the go-to person for Windows trouble shooting and technical support for family and friends.

                        <p>
                            I enjoy researching, designing and producing innovative PC builds, creating digital art, and online gaming. I am a board game fanatic, my collection spans 1200 titles and my favorite genres are legacy/campaign, war, area control and heavy Euro games.
                        </p>

                            Big 5 personality: Empathetic idealist – analytical thinker <br><br>
                            The test results highlight my preference for structure and organisation which I can use to help the team organise work flow and keep on track for deadlines. I tend to be a quiet worker and dislike confrontation, this can both be a positive for the team as I try to resolve conflict when it arises, but can also  influence my willingness to delegate tasks and ask for help. Having an awareness of my test results might provide other members of the group insight into how and why I approach the project and tasks in a particular way.

                        <p>
                            Born in China, grew up in Australia, and got to enjoy the best of both worlds. Fluent in English and can speak a decent amount of Mandarin Chinese. <br><br>
                            My interest in IT began since I first moved to Australia when I was 6 years old. It began when I went to my first computer class in grade 2, I saw a whole bunch of Apple IIe computers lined up on the desks. When I turned it on and started tapping away at the old keyboards, seeing the screen light up, I was hooked. From then on, I started learning as much as I could from class, books, magazines and through trial and error whenever given the chance.
                        </p>
                        <h6 class="text-info font-weight-bold">IT experience</h6>
                        <p>
                            My IT experience mostly involve Windows and Office 365 troubleshooting support. I have some experience in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Dreamweaver from personal interest, but they’re not needed in my current job.

                        <p>
                            I’m a huge fan of all types of computer games, wasting countless hours away in Dota 2, World of Warcraft and multiple coop titles. I also enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes that I find off websites like Yummly. It’s a great feeling seeing friends and family try and enjoy new cuisines through food that I’ve made.

                            My test results reflect my inclination towards working independently and solving problems strategically. I’m happy to be given a task and be allowed the freedom to complete it without outside interference. While I do my best to work with colleagues in group situations, I prefer meetings to be direct and to the point so that I can get back to work on my tasks. That said, communication will be key in this project and it’s something I will be mindful of while working with my team members.

                            I have grown up in Australia specifically Cairns, I now live in Victoria studying at RMIT and working as a meat inspector. <br><br>I first became interested in IT when I received a Lego robotics kit as a gift. This gave me the opportunity at a young age to create all different sorts of semi-autonomous robots. They started off very simple often falling apart upon impact of a wall at high speed. The robots I built soon became more sophisticated and were able to navigate through the house in different ways by themselves.

                            I have 7 years part time, weekend experience using point of sale software in a hardware shop. However, this required more customer troubleshooting than IT problem solving.

                            I have been raised predominately in Australia by Argentine parents who moved back and forth between Sydney and Argentina. Part of my primary and high school education was taught in spanish. <br><br>
                            Technology was never part of my upbringing or teenage years and was therefore not on my radar until I fell into a job working in an IT company in 1998. Since then, I have worked in various non-technology roles within IT companies. My interest in pursuing IT study more than 22 years later is driven by a desire to develop a deeper understanding technology fundamentals to progress my career.

                            I have 22 years of experience working in large technology companies, primary focused on product management, marketing and channel strategy. Surprisingly, none of the above roles have required a pre-requisite in technology. They are all roles that support or work with technical teams in operational, business and marketing administration.

                            My hobbies are unrelated to IT. I enjoy travelling and researching new countries, cultures and history. When not travelling, 9 times out of 10 I am researching new places to visit. I use travel as an excuse to educate my children about new cultures and unwind.

                        <p>
                            I'm an international student from Vietnam. I completed Year 12 and did my first year of university in Melbourne but dropped out due to personal circumstances. I can speak both Vietnamese and English<br><br>
                            My interest in IT started at a very young age, I remember spending so much time with my cousin playing games and tinkering with the system. Currently, my interest is shifting towards Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

                        <h6 class="text-info font-weight-bold">IT experience</h6>
                        <p>
                            I have been doing programming as a hobby in my pastime for the last 10 years and have been working professionally as a software and web developer for 5 years.

                        <p>
                            My hobbies are programming, tinkering with IT and electronic systems, D.I.Y stuffs. Aside from that, I also enjoy movie nights with my wife and love playing tennis.

                            The results are quite accurate and help me to understand a lot more about my strengths and weaknesses. They prove that I am an analytical, logical and abstract thinker as I love to think about things from the perspective of how it works and what makes it work. They also show that I could be 50% introverted and need to improve my social skills in order to benefit the team.

                            There are a range of ideal jobs in our group, including full stack developer, software engineer, UX/UI designer and Channels Director. Despite the diversity of job titles, there are significant similarities in both the general and technical skills and knowledge required for most of these roles.<br><br>
                            Technically, four out of five of the roles required knowledge of programming languages, and three required knowledge of modern web development frameworks,
                            cross platform abilities and experience with Agile methods. In terms of general skills, all of the roles require well-developed communication skills (written/oral), team work skills and interpersonal skills. There was also a strong call for project management skills, research and analysis skills, and passion and enthusiasm in the respective advertisements. Four out of five of the roles explicitly required the completion of at least a Bachelor degree.<br><br>
                            The main differences between roles can be seen in the specific technical skills required in some areas, for example, UX/UI design skills, wireframing and prototyping, and cloud experience, and in the relative importance of leadership skills. One of the roles is a senior management role, which is different from the other four roles that are more narrowly focused on specific and technical IT roles. The management role requires more than 10 years of experience,
                            where the other roles require 0-5 years of experience. In addition, only the senior management position requires the completion of postgraduate business qualifications.<br><br>
                            While the job titles vary, the analysis of the team’s ideal job advertisements reveals significant similarities in terms of both the general and specific skills that we need to develop to succeed in obtaining these roles.

                            The GitHub audit trail doesn’t reflect our group’s work well as we chose to collaborate using Microsoft Teams.  This means that the Git audit trail is limited to showing who uploaded the completed artefacts rather than showing the progress of each artefact towards completion.  The images below show how we used a gantt chart (figure 1) to map our project, and track the completion of components.  In addition, we created deadline lists for each week to break down the project and improve our focus and accountability (figure 2).  As we collaborated and negotiated in Microsoft Teams, the post history (appendix 1) provides a good record of group progress and decision-making.

                           First Step was forming a group. A few of us had failed attempts joining a group that was unresponsive. After attending a tutorial run by Glen, we were encouraged to chat live during Glen’s tutorial and this group formed Group 19. The first tool we used was Canvas to invite the newly formed team to collaborate.

                            Microsoft Teams became our primary chat and collaboration tool. Within Microsoft teams, the primary functions we used to collaboration were “Posts” to raise questions, discuss ideas and update the team on progress. We also used “Files”, where all files were uploaded for the purpose of sharing, updated and editing.
